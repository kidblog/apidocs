--- Kidblog API ---
---
Kidblog's API allows users to authorize your application to access protected 
resources (posts, comments, uploads). See the [OAuth 2.0 spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for general information.
Kidblog uses the [Authorization Code Grant](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1)
login flow designed for server-to-server (i.e. confidential) communication.

TLS/SSL/HTTPS connections are required, and HTTP requests are refused.

OAuth 2.0 Login Flow and Resource Access
----

Your application directs the user to a URL at Kidblog where they will approve (or deny) access to their protected content.
Upon confirmation, an HTTP redirect will provide your application with an _authorization code_.
The _authorization code_ is immediately exchanged for an _access token_, 
which is required for all subsequent requests for protected resources. If the _access token_ expires, 
your application can submit its _refresh token_, which was provided with the original access token.

Authorization
--
This endpoint is the initial target of your application's authorization request. It will display a confirmation dialog (and Kidblog login form, if no active session is found) to the user.
Your application will identify itelf via query string parameters. As such, no private information (such as the client_secret) should be transmitted with this request.


Example Request URL

        Note that the "http://kidblog.org" prefix is not required for the value of this parameter. To acquire this value, the user will need to enter "THE_CLASS_PATH" into your application before being taken to the authorization dialog, or it can be autopopualted based on session information provided by the referral URL to your application (e.g. if a user accesses your site via referral code).</td>

During authorization, Kidblog may need to direct the user to the login page. The value of this parameter should match the Kidblog ID visible on the user's Kidblog profile page.
        The user will need to enter their Kidblog ID into your application before being taken to the authorization dialog, or it can be autopopualted based on session information provided by the referral URL to your application (e.g. if a user accesses your site via referral code).</td>

Note for the demo json response below, there is a simulated error response encountered when troubleshooting query string parameters. A successful request will return an HTML confirmation dialog/login form.

error: "invalid_client",
error_description: "No client id supplied"
}



-- Access Token --
After obtaining an _authorization code_ in the query string of the redirect URI at your domain (described above), your application should transparently 
connect to this endpoint using an HTTP client library on your server.
Your application will exchange the _authorization code_ for an _access token_ by providing your client secret in the payload of the request.
It's the client secret that validates your application as an authorized bearer of the token. The client secret should be protected like a password and reset if compromised.
The _authorization code_ has a short shelf life, so it should be exchanged for the _access token_ immediately.

-- Refresh Token --
After a relatively short amount of time (~ 1 hour) an _access token_ expires. Rather that requiring the user to reauthorize your application,
you can exchange a _refresh token_ for a new _access token_. The _refresh token_ was delivered with the _access token_ (above). 
 Similar to the authorization code exchange, you should use an HTTP client library on your server 
to connect securely to the refresh token endpoint. Once a refresh token is used, it cannot be used again so your application will need to update its refresh token with a new one retirned with the new access token.

-- Verify --
Once your application has obtained a valid access token, you're ready to request protected resources. 

Resource requests must provide the <em>access token</em> in 

1. the Authorization header, or
2. the body of a x-www-form-urlencoded POST request

For security, only one of these two methods can be used at a time, and embedding the <em>access token</em> in the query string is not supported.

This endpoint is a helper URL to verify the status of your access code and to ensure that the access code being presented was indeed assigned to your application/client. To access content for a particular user, your application will target specific endpoints for the desired resources.

GET /oauth2/verify
> Authorization: Bearer <access token>
< 200
< Content-Type: application/json
{
    "success": true,
    "client_id": "8675309",
    "user_id": "1234"
}

-- User Info --
With a valid access token, you can retrieve information about the user account that granted access. 

Authenticate your request using the Authorization header of the HTTP request (with value "Bearer &lt;<em>acces_token</em>&gt;" the same as the "[/oauth2/verify](http://docs.kidblog.apiary.io/#verify)" endpoint

You'll need the user's numeric user id to access their resources.

GET /oauth2/userinfo

< Content-Type: application/json
{
    "user_id": "1234",
